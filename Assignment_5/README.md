The code implements a phone directory using a Binary Search Tree (BST), which efficiently organizes and manages contacts based on their names. The TreeNode class represents each node in the tree, holding a contact (a tuple containing a name and phone number) and pointers to its left and right children. The BinarySearchTree class contains methods for inserting, searching, deleting, and displaying contacts. When a new contact is inserted, the _insert method recursively finds the correct position in the tree based on alphabetical order of names, ensuring the left child contains names that come before the current node and the right child contains names that come after. Searching for a contact employs the _search method, which traverses the tree, comparing names until it finds the desired contact or reaches a null node. Deletion is handled by the _delete method, which accommodates three cases: removing a node with no children, one child, or two children, with the latter case utilizing the in-order successor for replacement. Finally, the display_directory method performs an in-order traversal to print all contacts in sorted order.
